# LSTM Model

Intstructions to replicate:

Take original data file (in csv format), and run it through new_editor1.py, then through new_editor2.py, then through half_hour_agg.py. This outputs by_half_hour.csv

To evaluate the model different datasets, run them through new_editor1.py, then through new_editor2.py, and then input_time_agg.py, which allows for the user to manually pick a time to aggregate by. This outputs LSTM_by_time_period.csv

Final_LSTM_SD_v3.ipynb is the main file for this part of the project.
